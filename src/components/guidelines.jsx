                    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        This should clearly state the purpose of the study and identify what issues are going to be addressed. This should contain the background, the gap in 
                        literature, research objectives, hypothesis if applicable, and significance of your study.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        All relevant attributes of the material forming the subject of the research should be provided. Experimental methodology should be concisely and appropriately explained.
                        Commercially produced materials, devices, software, etc. must be followed by name of manufacturer and location.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Statistical methods should be clearly specified for quantitative analysis.
                        Manuscripts reporting human studies should include evidence that study was ethically conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This section should include: research design, population and sampling including the exclusion and inclusion criteria, instrumentation, ethical consideration (Ethical Approval or Research Approval from Research Ethics Board or Agency is NEEDED/MANDATORY in all EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS 
                        involving living subjects like animal, plants, humans, etc.), data collection, and treatment of data.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Results</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        This section should succinctly state the results without any lengthy discussion or interpretation of individual data. Data should be presented using tables, illustrations, and graphs. Data in table or illustration form should be referenced in the text, not repeated (e.g. detailed information should not be given in text and tables).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Statistical tests should be clearly defined, and statistical significance should be shown in both figures and tables with the help of superscripts such as a, b, c, rather than *, ¶, # or other nonsequential symbols. The discussion should focus on the new and important findings of the study. The observations should be related to other 
                        relevant studies in a logical sequence. It should summarize, but not repeat the Results.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                                Photographs must be in color, in focus, free of distracting artifacts and consistent in exposure. Place any required labels or arrows on images prior to uploading. Images must be <b> at least 600 by 450 pixels (proportional height) </b> in size when in landscape orientation with a resolution of <b> at least 300 pixels per inch</b>. 
                                Graphs should be approximately <b>500 pixels wide</b> so that all labelling can be read with data points clearly visible. Substantially larger images must be avoided to prevent file transmission and electronic manuscript processing errors. Radiographs, drawings, and graphs can be in black and white, but color images are preferred. All images are to be placed in numerical order within the main manuscript and accompanied by a legend describing the content of the image.
                            </p>
                            <li>Tables</li>
                            <p>
                                Tables are placed in numerical order within the manuscript. A legend is to accompany all tables and call outs are to be placed in the body of the text to indicate where the table is to be located in the article. The tables function in Microsoft Word is to be used to create data tables rather than using columns of tabbed information.
                            </p>

                    <p>
                        The Discussion should end with a summary of the data and conclusions. The conclusions should be linked with the aims and objectives of the study and should clearly state whether the objective was achieved. Limitations of the study should also be mentioned.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        In academic writing, a well-crafted conclusion can provide the final word on the value of your analysis, research, or paper.
