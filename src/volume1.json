This method of communicating has been commonly used by teenagers to socialize with other people in their generation. The use of these texts has alarmed parents and teachers. This study was conducted to discover the correlation of this method of communication called “Tech Speak” to a student’s English proficiency. The researcher has surveyed grade 10 students, that has a total of 28 students, at Santiago National high school. The researcher used 10 words that are commonly misspelled as a parameter of the spelling test to measure the proficiency of both techspeak and non-techspeak students. The results yield an average of 8 and 7.7, thus making the students using Tech Speak more proficient in spelling than the students that are categorized as non-techspeak. The findings have led the researchers to conclude that the use of techspeak has no negative effects but rather it improves the student’s spelling proficiency.",

It assessed the Science-Enhanced Program’s strengths and weaknesses as viewed by alumni, collected their recommendations to improve the Science-Enhanced Curriculum in connection with current field demands, and constructed a SEP learner’s packet. This study used a mixed-methods strategy. A total of 238 respondents were purposefully selected via quota sampling. The alumni’s demographic profile based on their sex, civil status, educational attainment, employment information, as well as two extra questions, were collected using a tracer form. The first question focused on alumni perceptions of the science-enhanced program’s strengths and weaknesses, and the second question focused on their suggestions for improving the science-enhanced curriculum with respect to current field demands. After gathering the data and assessing the results, it has been concluded that the strengths of the science-enhanced program are the following: elective subjects offered, teaching quality, interdisciplinary learning, and student workload. Meanwhile, the learning environment, the research capacity, and the facilities provided were listed as the weaknesses of the said program. The respondents concurred that the curriculum should include courses in robotics, programming, and other IT-related topics. The alumni also agreed that students should be exposed to more real-world scenarios in the curriculum.

                        "abstract" : "Collaborative learning emphasizes student-to-student interaction and the instructor’s role as a facilitator. Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) was founded in 2005 by the State University of New York (SUNY) to help schools adapt their single classroom courses to an online, collaborative format and establish strong collaborations with professors with whom they would join classes and co-teach using SUNY COIL conferences and website, as well as pre-established partnerships between the institutions. However, as the globe becomes increasingly interconnected, educational challenges aimed at cultivating intercultural competency become more important (Ceo-DiFrancesco & Bender-Slack, 2016). That is why this study aimed to (1) understand the lived experience of students who went under the COIL program in relation to SDG 12, (2) review the new knowledge students obtained when they took part in the COIL program in relation to SDG 12, and (3) discover the challenges students encountered while participating in the COIL program in relation to SDG 12. The researcher surveyed Filipino and Japanese students who participated in the COIL program concerning SDG12 from St. Patrick School of Quezon City, Kwansei Gakuin University, and Meiwa Senior High School. The study employed qualitative phenomenological research, and pertinent data were obtained through an open-ended survey questionnaire. The study was analyzed using Colaizzi’s descriptive phenomenological method. The results showed that the lived experiences of students who went under the COIL program in relation to SD12 have something to do with all their learnings and enjoyable experiences, intercultural and global interactions, and environmental discussions and action plans related to SDG 12. Moreover, students learned and understood better the negative impact of waste on the environment, environmental awareness and practices, the culture and norms in the Philippines and Japan, and the importance and benefits of collaboration. Lastly, the study also revealed the different challenges students encounter while participating in the COIL program in relation to SDG 12, such as cultural differences, language barriers, technical difficulties, and difficulties in experimentation. Thus, it was recommended to learn to adapt to everyone and adjust according to countries’ different cultures, practice and be proficient with the English language, have backup devices and platforms to use to ease technological problems, and improve implementations of experiments.",

This study utilized two solar panel systems, the Static Solar Panel System and the Dual-Axis Solar Tracker and aimed to prove the significant difference generated by solar panel systems in terms of voltage and milliamps per hour. This study employed an Applied Experimental Research Design utilizing Arduino Uno, light-dependent resistors, micro servos, and solar panels to create the Dual-Axis Solar Tracker. The data gathered from the electric quantities during the seven-day sun exposure were tabulated, analyzed, and computed using mean tests, standard deviation, and T-tests to find the significant difference between the two solar panels. Based on the analyses of the data, it was revealed that the Dual-Axis Solar Tracker was superior in terms of voltage and milliamps per hour generated compared to the Static Solar Panel System. Moreover, computations using the T-test found that in terms of voltage and milliamps per hour generated, there was a significant difference between the Dual-Axis Solar Tracker and the Static Solar Panel System.

It aimed to determine the effectiveness of the different treatments of Cassava Starch-Rice Bran in terms of water resistance, tensile strength, and biodegradability. An experimental design was used in conducting the study. There were three treatments made in making CSRB straws: the first, with more rice bran; the second, with the same cassava starch and rice bran ratio; and the third, with more cassava starch. These treatments produced three replicates each. The straws were placed in a dehydrating machine for 24 hours at a temperature of 60° Celsius. The straws were then coated with beeswax after being removed from their respective molders. The CSRB straws were found to be water resistant due to the beeswax coating applied, although it had a weak tensile strength even with the presence of beeswax. The rate of biodegradability of the CSRB straw was fast due to it being made up of organic materials. The results revealed that straws made from Cassava Starch and Powdered Rice Bran are effective in terms of water resistance and biodegradability.",

In particular, the researcher was interested to determine if these factors had a significant effect on the students’ Pre-Calculus and General Mathematics performance considering the number of hours spent in modular learning. The period covered by the study was during the first semester of the school year 2020-2021. The respondents were all 67 Grade 11 STEM students of NDVNHS. A quantitative research design was utilized particularly using Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA). The findings of the study revealed that majority of the STEM students had a good performance in their Mathematics subjects for the first semester. Also, the factors specifically type of motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic) and support system (parents, siblings, relatives, friends, or classmates) had statistically significant effect on their mathematics performance in the new normal considering the amount of time they spent in learning using modules. Moreover, there were statistically significant differences in both Pre-Calculus and General Mathematics performances between the type of motivation and support system when adjusted for the number of hours spent in modular learning. Based on the findings, the study concluded that the students’ motivation and support system can greatly affect their mathematics performance when controlling for the allocated time in modular learning. Especially in Pre-Calculus and General Mathematics, motivation and support system are important factors in learning using modules. In the new normal education, the students should increase their level of motivation as well as exposure in self-learning and be given full support towards the processes in the modular approach of distance learning.",

This study sought to determine the level of procedural fluency in College Algebra as well as the difficulties and interventions applied by tertiary students of Cotabato State University (CSU) in the flexible learning set-up. The period covered by the study was during the first semester of the school year 2021-2022. The respondents were a sample of 30 first-year mathematics major students of CSU. It used mixed methods; the quantitative approach was utilized to know the students’ knowledge of procedures in solving mathematical problems while the qualitative approach was utilized to explore the difficulties of the students in learning mathematics as well as the coping strategies that can serve as basis for mathematics intervention program. The findings revealed that most of the respondents have a low level of procedural fluency in College Algebra, particularly emerging in the understanding the problem, devising a strategy, and solving steps while inept in the problem-solving checking process. On the part of new normal learning, difficulties were experienced such as poor knowledge of the prerequisite skills and unstable internet connection. As part of their interventions, facing the encountered problems, practicing repeatedly, and watching online video tutorials were applied. Based on the findings of the study, it is concluded that the first-year students have low level of procedural fluency in College Algebra problem-solving particularly in the Polya’s principles of understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and checking the answer.

This study utilized two groups that consisted of an experimental group where induced magnetism was present one control group where there was an absence of induced magnetism in the seed germination of Radish (Raphanus sativus). Moreover, this study aimed to determine the significant difference between the two in terms growth rate, growth speed, shoot growth, and overall development. Both groups had the same amount of radish (Raphanus sativus) seeds planted in a rectangular wooden container with the same amount of measurement and soil content. This study used an experimental research design by utilizing the functions of an Electromagnetic Induction Device (EID) comprised of a 12v motor battery, light bulb, coiled wire, and switch. The EID was turned on for 10 minutes every day where the electric volts generated by the 12v motor battery were transported through the coiled wire and distributed to the metallic iron screen surrounding the area of the experimental group. The data gathered during the 12-day observation of the growth of radish (Raphanus sativus) were tabulated, analyzed, and evaluated using mean tests, standard deviation, and T-test. Based on the result and analyses of the gathered data, it was found that the experimental group, the one with the presence of induced magnetism, surpassed the control group in terms of growth speed, shoot growth, and overall seed development. However, it was also revealed that in terms of growth rate, there is no significant difference between the control group and experimental group. Therefore, the utilization of Induced Magnetism on the seed germination of radish (Raphanus sativus) is effective in terms of growth speed, shoot growth, and overall development.",

However, demotivation in learning English as a second language remains to be a serious challenge. Thus, research-based information is needed to shed light in unravelling the factors of demotivation among second language learners and to guide teachers in putting forward practical solutions to increase students’ motivation in second language learning. This study was conducted to find out the specific factors that hinder students’ desire to learn English as a second language. The researcher used descriptive research design and involved 1,302 students of Palawan State University Cuyo Campus selected through random sampling. Demotivating factors were measured using a modified questionnaire with reliability index of 0.85. Students’ self-confidence, learning content and context, focus of teaching and school facilities are revealed as demotivation to second language learning. The findings of this study may guide English teachers in designing teaching-learning contexts that are interesting and can boost student’s confidence in using English as a second language. It is also beneficial to policymakers and curriculum developers so that necessary policies may be implemented to improve school facilities, teaching strategies, and learning content and context.",

This paradigm shift places the learner at the heart of the educational process, recognizing their diverse needs and aspirations. Consequently, the achievements of learners have become crucial indicators of institutional success. While extensive research has focused on student affairs and services, limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of administration on realizing the objectives of these support systems. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the administration of learner-centered academic support systems and the attainment of desired outcomes in student affairs and services within higher education institutions in the Philippines. Utilizing a non-experimental correlational quantitative research design, a sample of three hundred fifty university students from various academic disciplines was randomly selected as participants. The findings demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the administration of learner-centered academic support systems and the achievement of desired outcomes in student affairs and services. As a result, the null hypothesis was rejected based on statistical analysis employing Pearson Correlation (r). These findings highlight the significant impact that learner-centered academic support system administration has on the realization of objectives in student affairs and services within the contemporary higher educational setting. To ensure sustained best practices in student development, it is imperative for the administration to foster collaboration with internal stakeholders and external partners. Recognizing that students are the focal point of instruction, their performance serves as a reflection of the institution’s commitment to providing quality education. By aligning administrative efforts with the evolving needs of students, institutions can enhance student affairs and services and create an optimal learning environment in the 21st century.",

However, there are Grade 7 students who need help with the essential skill of reading. These students need support for them to cope with the classroom demands. This transcendental phenomenological qualitative research aims to determine the academic experiences of struggling readers inside the classroom. Five struggling readers were the participants of this study. These five participants were purposefully selected after being recommended by the school reading coordinator. The interview guide questionnaire was the instrument of this study. The interview guide questionnaire contains open-ended questions that were validated by experts. One-on-one interviews were conducted for about 20 to 40 minutes each. Using an audio recorder, the interviews were recorded. After the interview, a verbatim transcription was made and thematic analysis was utilized to analyze the significant lines of the participants. The following themes were elicited from the participants’ responses, namely: lack of computer skills, limited visual attention span, hesitation and anxiety to participate, difficulty in interaction, difficulty with the use of technology in education, confusion with letter-sound identification, less motivation to learn, problem understanding the lesson, and slow in taking down notes. The participants attributed their reading difficulties to themselves, their teachers, and their parents. In light of these findings, it is strongly recommended that a robust and comprehensive reading recovery program be implemented. This program should address struggling readers’ multifaceted challenges and provide them with the necessary support to enhance their reading proficiency and overall academic performance.",

This is a qualitative case study that delved particularly into the issue of employee retention, especially of seasoned teachers and staff of the subject learning center. It used the interview method to generate an in-depth analysis as it revisited its HRM Program. To triangulate the data gathered, documents from websites and social media as well as artifacts were also utilized. There is a dearth of research on the Human Resource and Management Program in preschool education. Most studies are from India and China. In terms of the HRM Program in education, SWOT analysis was frequently used to help improve the program. There were negligible sources that used the balanced scorecard at the preschool level. Hence, a combination of the SWOT analysis and the Balanced Scorecard method were utilized – the SWOT Analysis to determine the problems the learning center faces vis-à-vis its HRM Program, and the balanced scorecard in the search for a solution or strategy to help solve the problem. Based on the study, these combined tools proved to be effective in revisiting the HRM Program of schools. After interviewing the Directress of EYLC, findings disclosed that to be able to improve the retention of employees in the learning center, the focus should be given to the hiring policies and procedures keeping in mind the job security of its targeted employees.

The researcher intends to quantify how social media usage affects juvenile delinquency. The research will examine mediating elements, including peer influence, self-esteem, and antisocial content. This study may educate parents, educators, politicians, and mental health experts on adolescent social media usage hazards. This study aims to establish evidence-based social media mitigation and youth development solutions. This research employed quantitative methodologies. The target population for this study will be two hundred (200) criminology students of Headstart College of Cotabato. Participants will be selected using a time-efficient random selection strategy. The findings of a power analysis will be used to calculate the sample size needed to achieve the desired level of statistical significance. The researcher will administer the survey questionnaire face-to-face after proper coordination with the College head. Respondents had enough time to complete the survey questions. The researcher and respondents will complete the questionnaire in their own time to gather and retrieve data: data quantification, categorization, and statistical description. Weighted mean and correlation were utilized to assess the association between social media use and teenage delinquency and behavior. The researcher carried out all methods using SPSS Application Guide as statistical software. The study revealed that excessive social media use is associated with negative outcomes such as mental health issues, decreased social interactions, and potential impacts on academic performance. Additionally, the level of parental monitoring and communication regarding social media usage was varied, and family conflict related to social media use was evident to some extent. There needs to be more research done to determine the mechanisms that link adolescent social media usage and behavior. Longitudinal studies may help explain what happens and why, as well as suggest any necessary countermeasures.",

                    "abstract" : "Variations in people’s perceptions of investment risk and financial literacy have been linked in studies. More specifically, Diacon (2016) discovered significant differences between less financially savvy non-experts and financial professionals. Lay people therefore have a larger propensity for association bias (i.e., they give suppliers and salesmen a higher level of credibility than laypeople) and are often less risk-tolerant than financial professionals. The method of sampling that the researcher chose is known as purposeful sampling. According to Easton & McColl, it is a fundamental sampling strategy where the researcher chooses a smaller group of people (a sample) from a larger group (a population) to study. The responders of the survey included both commissioned and non-commissioned PNP members. There were 67 non-commissioned individuals and 33 commissioned personnel. These individuals are at work while this study is being done. Because they think mutual funds can invest in a variety of assets in the future, think savings account interest is higher than that on fixed deposit accounts, and even budget their monthly income for expenses, savings, and investments, survey participants can be inferred to rate their level of financial knowledge as extremely high. Additionally, people learn about investments from their peers and think that growing costs will limit purchasing power. They also get banking advice from dependable friends. Because they want to make sure that they are not concerned about loans as long as their savings are protected and they refrain from purchasing non-essentials, police responders are persuaded that they have a very high attitude toward their finances. They also believe that investing in a business is a better use of their money than spending it now, that saving money over time is more satisfying than spending it now, and that their financial status is a big problem or a source of stress. The poll participants believe that their level of financial conduct is pretty high since the separate their needs and wants, have begun saving for their retirement, and consistently save money each pay period. They also budget their money, regulate their spending, and always pay their bills on time.",

(Plagiarism) According to Abdullah, et. al., (2022) team building training can improve group cohesiveness or the quality of sticking together or unity teamwork more likely to be higher with a significant score difference. This study used mixed methods both qualitative and quantitative data collection, and an analysis method to answer the research method, random sampling is named as such because the data set is chosen via random selection, where every member of the population has an equal probability of being selected (Tao, 2023). The respondents were 100 restaurant employees and 10 managers from the chosen restaurant in Malolos City in Bulacan. The subcategories of team building, including activities, communication, skills, personality, problem-solving, and values, have all received a consensus of strong agreement, with weighted averages falling within the range of 3.26 to 3.44. This level of agreement aligns with the scores for motivation at 3.43 and productivity at 3.38. These values have been calculated by determining the mean, which spans from 3.25 to 4.00. The advantages of team building that is being observed by the managers is to create familiarity and teamwork among the employees, to improve the quality of service and the quality of the food especially the respondents are in the food service sector, development, and training for the employees to achieve the establishments’ goal and lastly rebuilding and build a relationship with one employee to another. However, for the disadvantages, it costs a lot of money to conduct team building in the management. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected. Despite the fact that there is a low correlation between teambuilding activities and motivation and employee productivity, there is still a significant relationship between the variables.",

While emotions were recognized as influential factors in the learning process, the specific relationship between emotional presence and cognitive outcomes remained elusive, particularly in the context of virtual classrooms. This research addressed a critical gap by investigating the relationships between emotional presence and students’ academic achievements in online classes. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach incorporating both quantitative and qualitative components was used. Fifty (50) senior high school students engaged in online learning were selected through the purposive sampling technique. Quantitative findings revealed that emotions did not exhibit a significant correlation with students’ academic achievements in the online learning environment. However, insights from the qualitative analysis shed light on the emotional experiences of students, indicating negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, and disappointment. Despite these challenging emotions, students were still capable of achieving favorable academic outcomes. In conclusion, while the emotional presence of students may have been predominantly negative, their academic achievements in online learning environments remained satisfactory. This suggested that learners could effectively navigate and succeed within the virtual classroom setting, even in the face of emotional challenges. Educators were encouraged to create supportive online learning environments that highly addressed students’ emotional needs alongside their educational requirements. By fostering emotional well-being, teachers could enhance the overall learning experience and promote positive outcomes in virtual education.",

Using CNNs, a MATLAB-Based approach is used to investigate dataset testing and training techniques for obtaining enhanced human-like frame prediction using CNNs in diverse scenes. Furthermore, studies were explored in Deep Learning, which is a kind of Machine Learning that can be trained, supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised. Specifically, the proposed study applies deep learning methods, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for next-frame prediction. The Catz Dataset is utilized as the training data for this investigation. The experimental results reveal that CNNs can indeed be used to achieve human-like frame prediction in diverse scenes. The best performing model, a hybrid CNN and LSTM network, exhibits a significantly improved perceptual distance rating of 26.7127, outperforming the initial CNN model. These findings demonstrate the potential of CNNs trained using deep learning techniques for accurate frame prediction tasks. The study has also shown that impact of the training and testing ratios on the performance of an enhanced human-like frame prediction using CNNs and MATLAB. The experiments through MATLAB have shown that higher training percentage means that a larger portion of dataset for training the model have been used while a lower training percentage shows that a large portion of the dataset reserved for testing the model’s performance.",

A descriptive qualitative design was employed, and video recording served as the research instrument of the study. The fifteen (15) participants were chosen at random using the fishbowl method. The researcher transcribed the speech verbatim and used content analysis to assign codes to each line of speech. The students used different strategies to convince the audience of their logical reasoning, credibility, and emotional appeal. Among the three Aristotelian modes of persuasion, Logos was the most commonly used, followed by Ethos and Pathos was the least used. The most prevalent strategy employed by the participants in Logos was to give factual objective information, followed by using credible supporting materials and providing examples to support the proposition. Under Ethos, sharing credentials or relevant personal experiences, followed by citing credible sources to appear competent, was found to be the most frequently employed strategy by participants. With regard to Pathos, providing lay testimony like sharing personal stories was revealed to be the most utilized persuasive strategy by the participants to build personal connections. The study suggested that English teachers make classroom activities that will lead students to use different ways of persuasion in their speeches. In addition, school administrators could also promote speech activities like speech competitions encouraging students to employ Aristotle’s persuasive strategies.",

The study utilized an explanatory mixed-methods design that involved two phases. In Phase 1, a self-constructed questionnaire was administered to 71 purposively sampled respondents to assess the five facets of school management. Phase 2 employed semi-structured interviews to further support or refute the collected data in Phase 1. The findings revealed that AR schools effectively navigated the challenges of the pandemic by implementing various strategies. Collaborative meetings were established at the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, the schools prioritized the development of leadership skills, knowledge, and abilities through training and professional development opportunities. The schools also modified their calendars, plans, and programs to suit the evolving needs of the students. Thus, 21st-century skills and competencies were integrated into the curriculum. To ensure effective monitoring, the schools invested in new/additional Learning Management Systems. To strengthen the school-parent relationship, the schools developed group chats and other communication channels to disseminate important announcements and information. Additionally, orientations, meetings, and seminars were conducted to educate parents. To engage with the community, AR schools intensified their presence through social media campaigns and promotions. Moreover, they actively organized and participated in outreach programs, fostering meaningful connections with the community. Based on these findings, the study proposes a comprehensive School Strategic Improvement Plan (SSIP) to enhance school management strategies further. This plan aims to sustain the positive outcomes achieved during the pandemic and position AR schools for continued success in the future.",
